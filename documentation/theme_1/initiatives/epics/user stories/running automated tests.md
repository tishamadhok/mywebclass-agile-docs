As a quality assurance engineer, I want to be able to run automated tests as part of the software development process so that we can catch bugs and errors before they make it to production.


Acceptance Criteria:
1. The ability to write and execute automated tests using a chosen testing framework or tool.

2. The ability to integrate automated tests into the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

3. The ability to generate test reports and track test results.

4. The ability to define and manage test data and test environments.

5. The ability to maintain and update automated test suites as the software evolves.
