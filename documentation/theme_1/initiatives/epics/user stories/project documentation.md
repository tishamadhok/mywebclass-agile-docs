As a project manager, I want a template for project documentation that includes sections for project goals, timelines, risks, and resources so that I can create consistent and comprehensive project documentation.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The template should cover all important aspects of project documentation, such as project scope, objectives, timelines, deliverables, risks, and dependencies.

2. The template should be easy to understand and use, with clear instructions and examples provided where necessary.

3. The template should be customizable to suit the specific needs of different projects and organizations.
