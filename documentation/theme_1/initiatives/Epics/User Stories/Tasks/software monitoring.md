Task: Set up a Software Monitoring and Alert System for Support Team

User Story: As a support team member, my aim is to quickly recognize and address software issues to ensure high customer satisfaction by implementing a software monitoring and alerting system.

Description: To promptly and effectively support end-users, a member of the support team should have the capability to easily detect and diagnose software issues. To achieve this objective, the support team should establish a software monitoring and alerting system capable of monitoring and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and issuing alerts when any KPI falls below a defined threshold.

Effort Estimate: A few hours to several days

Assigned To: Support team member in charge of software support

Priority: High

Status: In progress

Notes: The support team member should be able to access the monitoring and alerting system from their workstation without requiring any additional hardware or software.
